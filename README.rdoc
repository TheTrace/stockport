**** Things I need...
- view by timeline as to when stock was bought, high/low whilst I've had it and percentages over time
- be able to see capital gains AND dividend income
- sort transactions index by company (not just it's 'id')

# Oct 2015
Need to:
- Need to set currency as part of the company model - related to country (& bourse)
- Default country, bourse, currency based on one or the other of these things
- When creating a transaction, can default some stuff based on the stock selected

# Nov 2015
- Put the stock value etc from controller into the company - could YHOO cope with multiple?  maybe there's a batch way to do it?
- In holdings add the stock value currently (what if scenario for sold ones) - i.e. current price x number of shares held (need way of knowing that)
- Want to add Â£5 expenses to expenses and not take them off incomes until required
- Make holdings expandable - i.e. hide the details of transactions 'til clicked on

# Dec 15
- Get easy way for company price - store it somewhere and update when X-time old and required
- Get price history - store similarly
- Show price history (graphs, etc)
- jQuery UI for date selectors
- Instant search for companies - use webservice too!
- When reviewing a holding, it would be nice to see the high & low for the period held
- Need to have a watchlist with alerts for points reached (high/low)
- Need somewhere to hold max buy/sell rate (& keep history) - and way of working it out (on my own if necessary)
- May need to build in ForEx somewhere along the way?
- Need way of showing the FTSE and other indices
- Will need to add pagination on Transactions (perhaps Companies and Holdings too). Portfolios shouldn't grow beyond a "page" worth.

# Jan 16
- Need a portfolio of portfolios
- Need to have a portfolio with just companies (not holdings)


Done:
Remove calculated fields like:
- Payable
- Cost Percent
- Avg Cost
Add "Name" to holding, maybe "Description" too
Add "User" to holding
Add select_for for holding
Add total_expense to holding
Add total_income (maybe get rid of/or automatically update book_val) to holding
Add all the framework for holding (CRUD)
- Might need more details in transaction for dividends (income/expense broken down for holdings)
	- need Tax Rate (e.g. 10%)
	- need Tax Credit
	- need Gross Dividend (= Net Dividend Paid + Tax Credit) -> calculated value
- need to do list of transactions as an include (for index and for holdings) - use options as to what to show (don't need the company as a sub-set of the holding)
